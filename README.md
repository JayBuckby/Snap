# Snap

A simple card game based on the rules of Snap, created in Intellij with Java.

To start the game, you must click the play icon (>) in the Main class.

Once the project has been initialised, a card is drawn out automatically for Player one.

Player two must then hit the ENTER key on the command line in Intellij to draw another card.

Once a "snap" match has been presented (matching the same value of the face card) then the player must type in snap in the command line to claim the victory, otherwise the chance will be missed and another card must be drawn!

On a successful win, the opportunity will be presented to play again or to stop playing.
